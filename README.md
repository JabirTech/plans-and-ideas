# Plans and Ideas for Jabir Technologies Projects

In this repository, every future product, idea or research subject for _Jabir Technologies_ will be placed and explained. This repository is _not_ any form of __documentation__ but a very fine form of announcement. Products documentations will be available in their respective place in our [website](https://jabirtechnologies.org)

## For Enterprise Users

Jabir Technologies will be providing a server operating system for _enterprise users_. This operating system will be based on _Debian GNU/Linux_ and will use [jubs](https://github.com/JabirTech/jubs) as the unified base system installer. On this operating system, everything an enterprise user may need will be provided.

The main business model for this part of the project will be development, support and deployment of JabirOS regarding the user/customer needs.
