# Plans and Ideas for Jabir Technologies Projects

In this repository, every future product, idea or research subject for _Jabir Technologies_ will be placed and explained. This repository is _not_ any form of __documentation__ but a very fine form of announcement. Products documentations will be available in their respective place in our [website](https://jabirtechnologies.org)

## For Enterprise Users

Jabir Technologies will be providing a server operating system for _enterprise users_. This operating system will be based on _Debian GNU/Linux_ and will use [jubs](https://github.com/JabirTech/jubs) as the unified base system installer. On this operating system, everything an enterprise user may need will be provided.

The main business model for this part of the project will be development, support and deployment of JabirOS regarding the user/customer needs.

## For Personal Users

### Definition of _personal_ user

Every user who uses Jabir Technologies products individually and doesn't have any _enterprise_ contract with us, will be considered a _personal_ user. Despite using our software products on multiple devices or using our hardware products in large quantities. The main goal of our organization is also providing a ground for all types of users to access a free (as in freedom) and secure computational platform.

### The Operating System

The base of most our product, is the operating system known as _JabirOS_. JabirOS, is a free and open source operating system based on _Debian GNU/Linux_ featuring a full set of desktop and mobile applications, optimized for day to day use by our users. The operating system will be available on a vast variety of system architectures in near future.

#### Devices supported by the operating system

For the first phase, all x86 machines (with a support of 64bit operating systems) will be able to run JabirOS. Also, as long as _desktop_ tests were okay on x86 machines, there will be an option for _Raspberry Pi_. Since Raspberry Pi becoming some sort of standard device for most of Linux ARM machines, it'll be a huge step for us to have our operating system up and running on a Raspberry Pi.

### Jabir TV

Ever heard of Apple TV? or those Xiaomi boxes? OK, non of them are free (as in freedom) or open source. On the other hand, they don't respect your privacy and personal rights of owning the hardware or software. Jabir TV, will be a privacy focused smart TV device, which will help you turn your normal TV display to a smart TV.

### Jabir Kiosk

A kiosk is basically a piece of hardware which can become a platform for running basically anything. From a simple privacy focused internet access point in an airport to a cool sports machine, or even an augmented reality try-on machine in an outfit or accessories store.

### Jarvis

Jarvis is a smart assistant, which will be available in the operating system. Also, users of other operating systems (which are compatible with GNU/Linux) will be able to install Jarvis. We also have plans for making Jarvis available as a hardware personal assistant as well, so it is Siri, Cortanan and Alexa at once and it also respects your privacy.

### Jabir Home
